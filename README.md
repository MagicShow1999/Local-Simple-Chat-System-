# Local-Simple-Chat-System-
This project implements a basic chat system using Python.

It can display who are online in the chatting system and provides users to options whether to connect someone or connect a group. It can also search for a poem with keywords and return the whole poem in formatted style. I implemented parts in ndexer_student.py and chat_group_student.py. Other works are implemented by professors @zhen zhang.
